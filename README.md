Website scraping &amp; AI Learning

This solution scrapes the quizzes produced by the website https://www.tassomai.com/
It records the questions presented and the associated answers. And by answering randomly, records the correct answer for future reference.
In this fashion, the script did my science homework.

Hardcoded in are values to get a certain amount of questions incorrect, to maintain legitimacy.
