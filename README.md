Website scraping &amp; AI Learning

This solution scrapes the quizzes produced by the website https://www.tassomai.com/
It records the questions presented and the associated answers. And by answering randomly, records the correct answer for future reference.
In this fashion, the script did my science homework.

Hardcoded are values to get a certain amount of questions incorrect, to maintain legitimacy.

The demo below is when the bot was not 100% accurate (small bugs and hadnt learned the data set completely). The code is perfect now though and the data set is complete.
